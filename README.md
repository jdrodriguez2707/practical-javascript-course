# Practical JavaScript Course ðŸŸ¡ 

Welcome to the repository of the Practical JavaScript Course by Platzi! In this course, I learned the essential fundamentals of DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Here's a summary of what we covered:

## What I learned:

1. Review of Basic Concepts:
   - Variables
   - Loops
   - Conditionals
   - Arrays
   - Functions

2. Array and Object Destructuring
```js
const daysOfWeek = [
  "Monday",
  "Tuesday",
  "Wednesday",
  "Thursday",
  "Friday",
  "Saturday",
  "Sunday",
];

let [monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, ...weekend] = daysOfWeek;
```

3. Basic DOM Manipulation:
   - Reading HTML from JavaScript using methods like `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, etc.
   - Modifying HTML from JavaScript with properties like `innerHTML` or `innerText`, and manipulating attributes and classes with methods like `getAttribute`, `setAttribute`, `classList` with methods like `add`, `remove`, `contains`, etc.

4. Basic Events:
   - `onchange`
   - `onclick`

5. Using `addEventListener` to listen to events like `click`, `submit`, or `dblclick`

6. Project: Basic Calculator
   - Creation of a basic calculator that allows the user to select the desired operation and input the numbers to operate. The result is dynamically displayed on the page.
